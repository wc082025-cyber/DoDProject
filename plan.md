# TODO

    - Write a simple text based game, where players have to choose to open right or left door.
    The purpose with the code is to get comfortable with simple bools,
    YES/NO, RIGHT/LEFT. And to get a understanding of how to code.
    First door, option to go left or right,
    second door, third door and fourth door.
    Each door leads to either progression or death until the right combination of doors have been found.
    When player dies or escapes, (YOU DIED) or (YOU ESCAPED) will write in terminal. When player dies or escapes, terminal will ask player
    (PLAY AGIN? Y/N) and the player must type Y or N to either stop playing and exit the program, or play another round. When player Chooses N The terminal will write (YOUR BLOODLINE IS WEAK) and exit program. If player choose Y terminal will write (NEW GAME)

     If time allows and I am able to code the program, I will try to first find a way to randomize order of the rooms. As for my current plan, the rooms have been drawn up as a map with all the answers. EXAMPLE, all rooms are in order, 1R, 1L, 2RR, 2LL as in 2RightRight and 2LeftLeft, are the number of the rooms. I want it to be as when player goes in room 4RR in "vanilla" it has an equal chance of going to door 4LRL. The Naming and structure of rooms will make sense on the visual map. in the second room, player always will get either SWORD or SHIELD.[i have no plans for now to attempt make an inventory for now] If that is aslo very managable, room 3 should have an enemy, where player depending on what what item picked up. The terminal will just write
     (A GUARD APPEARS) with the text (YOU KILLED A GUARD) or (YOUR SHIELD BLOCKED AN ATTACK, YOU COUNTER AND KILLED THE GUARD) depending on what item you got.
